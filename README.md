I changed the service level agreement to plan A and updated help topic to reportt a problem business critical outage then assigned it to user Jane on the online banking team.

as user Jane. resolved the ticket by clicking "open" and changing it to resolved.

  To recap, I created a ticket as user Karen and observed it as user John where I was able to change the SLA and topic then assign it to user Jane on the online banking team and as Jane I resolved the ticket. By doing this I was able to show how giving different users and teams diferent accesses and permissions can effect how users are able to interact with the software.
